Grain Quality Prediction Project

A Python-based solution that analyzes the quality of rice grains by computing each grain’s length-to-breadth ratio from input images and grading rice quality based on that measurement. This enables real-time, reliable grain quality assessment for agriculture and food-industry applications.

📌About:

This project processes rice grain images to detect and measure individual grains, then calculates their length/breadth ratio. Using these measurements, it classifies the rice sample’s quality, which can help in grading, sorting, and quality assurance workflows for agricultural producers, buyers, or labs.

📌Built With:

Python - Core programming language.
OpenCV (or similar) - For image processing and grain detection.
NumPy - Numerical computing.
